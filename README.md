We can take the advantage of different machine learning algorithm to predict the natural disaster. Predicting natural disaster comes under the category of classification problem as we want to predict the occurrence of different natural disasters. We can use large data-sets(satellite image data), divide them into training set and testing set for different classification algorithms like logistic regression, SVM , decision tree, K nearest  neighbor and neural network to train the algorithm , then we can use regularization methods to get rid of any stochastic noise which is associated with the pattern learnt by the algorithm which enhances the prediction accuracy. From the data-sets, the algorithm can train itself to detect the anomaly in the weather pattern to detect tornadoes,tsunamis and earthquakes,use infrared images to detect volcanoes or forest fires. These kinds of simple application of machine learning can help us tackle different natural disaster by taking appropriate measures beforehand and save innumerable lives devastated from it.
